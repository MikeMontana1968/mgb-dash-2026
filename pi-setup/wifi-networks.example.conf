# MGB Dash 2026 — WiFi Networks
#
# Copy this file to wifi-networks.conf and fill in your credentials.
# wifi-networks.conf is gitignored — credentials stay local.
#
# Format: SSID,PASSWORD,PRIORITY
#   - Higher priority = preferred network (tried first)
#   - One network per line
#   - Lines starting with # are ignored
#
# The first network (highest priority) should be your primary workshop WiFi.
# Raspberry Pi Imager also configures one network at flash time — that one
# persists and does not need to be listed here again.
